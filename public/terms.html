                                </ul>
                                    <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">Invite someone to join ntradeX, by either tapping on the “Share” icon displayed next to your x:tag on the "More" screen. This icon can also be found next to your x:tag in the "Profile Information" screen. </li>
                                    <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">Once you do this, a draft message containing your unique referral link as well as your x:tag will appear. You can customise the message and send it to your Referral/s. You agree you will not (attempt to) mislead anyone in connection with this Program. </li>
                                    <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">When sending referral messages, you agree you alone are the sender of the message, will only send it to people you know, have permission to send it to, will not “spam” anyone with referrals, and will remain compliant with all applicable laws. </li>

                            <h3 class="mil-mb-60 mil-up">10.3. What does your referral need to do for you to earn the Reward points?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">For you to be eligible for your Reward, your Referral must satisfy the below steps: <br> 
                                </ul>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up"><b>Successfully open and verify an ntradeX account</b>, for the first time, using your unique referral link. (Someone who has previously signed up for an ntradeX account with any of our global entities will not earn you a Reward.) You also cannot refer yourself and doing this violates the terms of this agreement and might lead to account suspension. The account the Referral opens must also be verified to at least Cadre 1, uniquely identifying that user within ntradeX. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up"><b>Top up their account from an external source</b> (like a card top-up or transfer from another bank, not a transfer from another ntradeX account or an x:tag transfer from you ("the Referrer") or another user within ntradeX). There is no minimum required amount to deposit. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up"><b>Perform a complete ntradeX transaction</b>. After your referral makes a deposit from an external source, they must exchange, and send a transfer payment in a currency different from the currency they deposited. For e.g, depositing NGN, exchanging to EUR, sending out EUR—this is a complete ntradeX transaction. As opposed to, depositing NGN, sending out NGN—this is an incomplete ntradeX transaction in the context of Referral and Rewards. When your referral makes a complete ntradeX transaction in total volume that equates to at least CA$250 or its equivalent in any other currency, you'll be eligible to receive x:points equal to 4,000xp, and your referral will be eligible to receive 1,000xp.</li>

                                <div>&nbsp;</div> 

                                <p class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-mb-30 mil-up">You will not be eligible for a Reward (or may have a Reward that has been previously paid reversed) if your Referral reverses and/or abuses one of these steps after taking it. For example, if you and your referral collude to repeatedly send funds in the same currency to each other with the aim of increasing transaction volume. This is considered malicious and will lead to automatic suspension of your account.</p>

                            <div>&nbsp;</div>   
                            <h3 class="mil-mb-60 mil-up">10.4. What other legal information should I know?</h3>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">The Program is a double-sided campaign, where both the ntradeX customer ("Referrer") who referred a friend and the friend ("Referred") can be awarded any Reward/s.</li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">To be eligible for a Reward, you must have an active ntradeX account (meaning that your account is not restricted, suspended, or terminated) throughout the Program and at the time you account is due for any Reward/s. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">If your account was suspended for malicious transactions between you and your referrals, you and your referrals will be ban from the Rewards programs and all linked account(s) will be suspended. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">We reserve the right to reverse any Reward/s credited to your ntradeX account if we become aware that you have breached these Program Terms. We will consider the reversal of any Reward to have been done with your consent and the payment to have been authorised by you. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">If we believe that you have engaged in any fraud or material abuse of the Program we may also in our sole discretion take any actions we see fit in the circumstances. For example, it would be a material abuse of the Program to orchestrate a campaign to profiteer from the Program in a way that does not result in genuine and unique new sign-ups to ntradeX, and so in addition to reversing any Reward/s, suspending your account and banning you from the Program, we may also close your ntradeX account. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">We may change, suspend or end the Program earlier than the end of the Program Period if, in our reasonable opinion, the Program is being abused or may negatively affect ntradeX’s goodwill or reputation, or due to unforeseen circumstances which may make it impossible for us to continue running the Program. We may suspend or end the Program on an individual or promotion-wide basis. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">If we need to change, suspend or end the Program before the end of the Program Period, we will try to give you notice through the app and/or email. ntradeX will not be liable for any loss, whether directly or indirectly suffered where we are unable to continue running the Program as planned. Please contact Support if you believe you qualify for a particular benefit in relation to the Program that has not been awarded to you as a result of early suspension or termination. </li>
                                <li class="mil-text-m mil-soft mil-up">By participating in this Program, you confirm that you understand that any Reward may be subject to local income tax in the country of your residence and/or in the local territory where you are tax resident. It is entirely your responsibility to pay any tax which may arise from receiving any Reward. ntradeX will bear no liability for any tax obligations which may arise from receiving any Reward as part of this Program. </li>
